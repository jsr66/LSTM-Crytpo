# LSTM-Crytpo

This project investigates the application of long short term memory (LSTM) neural networks to 1-day forecasting of the spread of cointegrated cryptocurrency pairs. The Engle-Granger cointegration method is used to find cointegrated pairs of cryptocurrencies and to calculate their spreads. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using time series cross validation and grid search. The main packages used are Python's keras, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy libraries. The code for  the project is contained in the Jupyter notebook LSTM_Crypto.ipynb. More in depth analysis is contained in Project_Report.pdf. Cryptocurrency price data is contained in the folder cryptocurrencypricehistory.
