# LSTM-Crytpo

This project investigates the application of a particular type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known as long short term memory (LSTM) networks to 1-day forecasting of the spread of a cointegrated cryptocurrency pair. The Engle-Granger cointegration method is used to find cointegrated pairs of cryptocurrencies and to calculate the spread. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using time series cross validation and grid search. The main packages used are Python's keras, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy libraries.

Python code is contained in the Jupyter notebook LSTM_Crypto.ipynb. More in depth analysis is contained in Project_Report.pdf. Cryptocurrency price data is contained in the folder cryptocurrencypricehistory.
